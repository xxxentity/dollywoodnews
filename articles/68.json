  "content": "<h3>Annual Community Appreciation Program Returns for Smoky Mountain Christmas</h3><p>Dollywood announced October 22, 2025, the return of Sevier County Days, inviting anyone who lives or works in Sevier County to visit the park November 1-9 for a non-refundable $5 donation to benefit local area nonprofits. The nine-day promotion coincides with the opening weekend of Smoky Mountain Christmas presented by Humana, Dollywood's award-winning holiday festival featuring more than six million twinkling lights and seasonal entertainment throughout the Pigeon Forge theme park. Sevier County residents must present a state- or federally-issued photo identification with a valid Sevier County zip code at any designated Dollywood ticket booth to receive admission, while those who work in Sevier County but live elsewhere must present proof of employment along with a state- or federally-issued photo identification matching the paycheck stub dated within the last thirty days. Children ages fifteen and under without photo identification may enter the park with a parent or legal guardian without being required to show proof of residency, providing families with accessible opportunities to experience Dollywood's holiday offerings during the promotional period. All net proceeds from the $5 donations support Sevier County area nonprofits addressing community needs ranging from food security and child advocacy to healthcare access and emergency assistance services throughout the region.</p><h3>Program Has Contributed Nearly $1.8 Million Since 2008 Launch</h3><p>Sevier County Days began in 2008 as Dollywood's community appreciation initiative recognizing the relationship between the theme park and the local population supporting its year-round operations through employment, business partnerships, and regional tourism promotion. Since the program's inception seventeen years ago, Dollywood Parks & Resorts has provided nearly $1.8 million to numerous Sevier County nonprofits through the accumulated $5 donations collected during the annual promotional periods typically scheduled during both summer and winter operating seasons. Organizations benefiting from Sevier County Days funding include Sevier County Food Ministries addressing hunger and food insecurity, Safe Harbor Child Advocacy Center providing services for abused children, Safe Space offering domestic violence intervention and prevention programs, Mountain Hope Good Shepherd Clinic delivering healthcare services to uninsured and underinsured residents, and Smoky Mountain Area Rescue Ministries supporting individuals experiencing homelessness and addiction challenges. Carol Agee, Dollywood Community Affairs and Philanthropy Manager, emphasized the program's importance during the holiday season: \"Our area non-profits take great care of our community each and every day, but as Christmas approaches, the demand for their services increases.\" The nearly $1.8 million charitable contribution represents one component of Dollywood's broader community investment strategy encompassing direct employment of thousands of local residents, procurement from regional suppliers, and support for education initiatives throughout Sevier County and surrounding East Tennessee communities.</p><h3>Tickets Provide Full Upgrade Value Toward 2026 Season Passes</h3><p>Dollywood structured the Sevier County Days promotion to provide participating residents and employees with additional value beyond the single-day admission, offering full upgrade credit toward the purchase of 2026 season passes for anyone choosing to convert their $5 promotional ticket. The upgrade incentive allows local community members who visit during Sevier County Days to apply the full $5 donation value as credit toward any 2026 season pass tier, effectively providing both charitable contribution recognition and personal benefit for participants considering annual pass purchases. Season pass options at Dollywood include multiple tiers offering varying levels of benefits such as free parking, bring-a-friend discounts, dining plan eligibility, and access to both Dollywood theme park and Dollywood's Splash Country water park throughout the operating season. The upgrade structure encourages first-time visitors and infrequent guests to experience Dollywood during the promotional period while establishing pathways for conversion to regular season pass holders who visit multiple times throughout the year, supporting both charitable objectives and long-term customer relationship development. Participants interested in season pass upgrades can complete the transaction at Dollywood ticket booths during their Sevier County Days visit or online through the park's website following their promotional admission, with the $5 credit applied automatically upon verification of the original Sevier County Days ticket purchase during the November 1-9 promotional window.</p><h3>Promotion Reinforces Park's Community Identity and Local Support</h3><p>Carol Agee highlighted the foundational role of community relationships in Dollywood's operations and identity: \"Dollywood is such a special place because of the community in which we are located.\" The statement reflects Dolly Parton's long-standing emphasis on maintaining strong connections between her theme park enterprises and the Sevier County residents who have supported her career since childhood, with Parton frequently referencing her East Tennessee roots and commitment to giving back to the region that shaped her personal and professional development. Sevier County Days represents one manifestation of this community-focused philosophy, providing tangible benefits to local residents through affordable park access while simultaneously generating charitable funding addressing pressing social service needs throughout the county. The timing of the November 2025 Sevier County Days during Smoky Mountain Christmas's opening week allows participants to experience Dollywood's most elaborate seasonal festival, featuring holiday-themed shows, seasonal dining offerings, and the park's signature light displays transforming the property into what industry publications have recognized as one of North America's premier Christmas attractions. Dollywood's positioning as both a major tourism destination attracting millions of annual visitors from across the United States and an integral component of local Sevier County community life creates unique dynamics distinguishing the park from corporate-owned theme park chains lacking similar regional ties and community investment traditions. The Sevier County Days program, along with Dollywood's broader employment practices prioritizing local hiring and the park's educational initiatives including scholarships and literacy programs, demonstrates how the entertainment venue functions simultaneously as a national tourist attraction and community anchor institution serving Sevier County residents beyond its role as a theme park destination.</p>"
