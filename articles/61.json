  "content": "<h3>Two-Day Coaster Enthusiast Experience Returns</h3><p>Thrills in the Hills returned to Dollywood on September 26-27, 2025, bringing coaster enthusiasts together for an exclusive two-day experience during the park's Harvest Festival featuring Great Pumpkin LumiNights. The special event provides participants with extended ride times, early park access, and behind-the-scenes opportunities unavailable during regular operating hours. Taking place throughout the park, the event coincides with the illuminating display of over 12,000 pumpkins, creating a unique atmosphere where thrilling rides meet autumn festivities in the heart of the Smoky Mountains.</p><h3>Comprehensive Package Delivers Premium Experience</h3><p>The Thrills in the Hills package includes park tickets for Friday evening and Saturday, preferred parking on both days, and extended evening ride time sessions that allow enthusiasts to experience their favorite coasters with minimal wait times. Saturday morning brings early ride time before general park opening, giving participants exclusive access to select attractions. The package also provides tasty snacks, a Saturday lunch to maintain energy throughout the day, an event t-shirt, and a goody bag filled with treats. T-shirt sizes are guaranteed for registrations completed by August 31, while those registering between September 1-14 receive shirts without size guarantees.</p><h3>Special Pricing Rewards Season Passholders</h3><p>Dollywood offers two pricing tiers for the Thrills in the Hills experience, with season passholders receiving significant savings. Regular ticket pricing stands at $134.72 plus tax, while season passholders enjoy a discounted rate of $94.63 plus tax. Child pricing options are available for younger enthusiasts, and passholders must sign into their accounts to access the special pricing. The value proposition includes two days of park admission, meals, parking, and exclusive experiences that would cost significantly more if purchased separately during regular park operations.</p><h3>Exclusive Access to World-Class Coaster Collection</h3><p>Participants gain special access to Dollywood's impressive roller coaster lineup, including Lightning Rod, the park's launched wooden coaster that races over the mountains, and Wild Eagle, the soaring wing coaster that provides breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. Mystery Mine offers its themed underground adventure, while Thunderhead delivers classic wooden coaster thrills. The extended ride times allow enthusiasts to experience these attractions multiple times without typical crowd constraints, maximizing ride experiences during the limited event timeframe.</p><h3>Perfect Timing During Peak Fall Season</h3><p>The September 26-27 timing places Thrills in the Hills at the height of Dollywood's fall season, when forests display vivid autumn colors and the aroma of apple and pumpkin treats fills the air. The event promises an illuminating experience of thrills and chills, combining the excitement of exclusive coaster access with the seasonal charm of the Harvest Festival. As Dollywood celebrates its 40th anniversary season in 2025, Thrills in the Hills represents another opportunity for the park to connect with its most passionate guests while showcasing the world-class attractions that have made it a premier destination for roller coaster enthusiasts.</p>"
